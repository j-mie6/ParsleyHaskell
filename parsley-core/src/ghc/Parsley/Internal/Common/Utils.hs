{-|
Pronounced \"with code\", this datatype is the representation for user-land values. It pairs
a value up with its representation as Haskell @Code@. It should be manipulated using
`Quapplicative`.

data WQ a = WQ { __val :: a, __code :: Code a }

{-|
This class is used to manipulate the representations of both user-land values and defunctionalised
representations. It can be used to construct these values as well as extract their underlying value
and code representation on demand.

It is named after the @Applicative@ class, with the @Q@ standing for \"code\". The @(`>*<`)@ operator
is analogous to @(\<*>)@ and `makeQ` analogous to @pure@.

  {-|
  Combines a value with its representation to build one of the representation types.

  Extracts the regular value out of the representation.

  Extracts the representation of the value as code.

  {-|
  Pronounced \"quapp\", this can be used to combine the code of a function with the code of a value.

  > const5 = makeQ const [||const||] >*< makeQ 5 [||5||]

  is the same as saying

  > const5 = makeQ (const 5) [||const 5||]

  It is more idiomatically found as the output to the @IdiomsPlugin@.
