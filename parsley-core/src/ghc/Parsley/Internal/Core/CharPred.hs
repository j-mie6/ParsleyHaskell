Description : Packaging of offsets and positions.
License     : BSD-3-Clause
Maintainer  : Jamie Willis
Stability   : experimental

This module contains `CharPred`, a specialised defunctionalising for @Char -> Bool@ functions.
This can be used to efficiently query for character class membership.

{-|
Occasionally, characters can pass through a predicate only to pass through another at a later point.
This given information can be used to optimise the new predicate the character is fed through.

This works as follows:

  * If the given knowledge is a subset of the new predicate, then we /know/ that any character check
    will have passed, because it already passed a stricter check. The predicate can, therefore, be
    optimised to `Item`.
  * Otherwise, the character can only pass through both predicates if it can pass through their
    intersection. If the intersection is smaller (in terms of the number of checks required to
    establish membership), then it should be used as it generates smaller code.
  * If neither of the above conditions are true, then the original predicate remains the most
    efficient for future tests.
