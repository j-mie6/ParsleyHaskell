Module      : Parsley.Internal.Frontend.Analysis.Cut
Description : Marks cut points in the parser.
License     : BSD-3-Clause
Maintainer  : Jamie Willis
Stability   : experimental

Exposes a transformation that annotates the parts of the grammar where cuts occur: these are places
where backtracking is not allowed to occur. This information is used to help with correct allocation
of coins used for "Parsley.Internal.Backend.Analysis.Coins": the combinator tree has access to scoping
information lost in the machine.

Annotate a tree with its cut-points. We assume a cut for let-bound parsers.

-- all bindings must assume no backtracking, but bindings may be entirely pure
-- this means they cannot satisfy a cut themselves: basically they behave like option(item)
-- analysis could be done to prevent this though!

-- obviously does not demand cuts for its children, however success of p may cause a cut

  in (mkCut (cuts && not backtracks) (In (Try p')), cuts)
-- cannot pass `backtracks` directly to `p` because it prevents a cut being issued on the <|>
-- this has an effect if it causes an illegal backtrack that is effectful:
--     put r0 False *> try (string("abc") <|> put r0 True) <|> get
-- the problem is with non-consuming right branches: if the right branch
-- is guaranteed to consume input, then there will be a shared input factored
-- out, even if it is just one -- this means that the first input read of
-- the <|> is guarded: even if there is internal factoring, it cannot backtrack
-- to the right branch if it didn't enter the branch to begin with or didn't discharge
-- the length-check (by failing on the free read).
--
-- So, how to fix? well, only allowing this if both branches must consume input
-- seems to work ok: this can be done by using the `rcuts` flag
-- TODO: However, this rules out a fully pure branch also working: any branch without /any/ effect could be factored
