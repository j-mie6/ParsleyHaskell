Module      : Parsley.Internal.Frontend.Analysis.Cut
Description : Marks cut points in the parser.
License     : BSD-3-Clause
Maintainer  : Jamie Willis
Stability   : experimental

Exposes a transformation that annotates the parts of the grammar where cuts occur: these are places
where backtracking is not allowed to occur. This information is used to help with correct allocation
of coins used for "Parsley.Internal.Backend.Analysis.Coins": the combinator tree has access to scoping
information lost in the machine.

Annotate a tree with its cut-points. We assume a cut for let-bound parsers.

-- to the right branch if it didn't enter the branch to begin with or didn't discharge
-- the length-check (by failing on the free read). (we are talking about factoring solely on the p here fyi)
