Module      : Parsley.Precedence
Description : The precedence parser functionality
License     : BSD-3-Clause
Maintainer  : Jamie Willis
Stability   : stable

This module exposes the required machinery for parsing expressions given by a precedence
table. Unlike those found in [parser-combinators](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/parser-combinators-1.3.0/docs/Control-Monad-Combinators-Expr.html)
or [parsec](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/parsec-3.1.14.0/docs/Text-Parsec-Expr.html), this
implementation allows the precedence layers to change type in the table. This implementation is
based off of /Design Patterns for Parser Combinators (Willis and Wu 21)/.

{- $prec-doc
Compared to using chain combinators to construct parsers for expression grammars, precedence
combinators provide a light-weight and convenient representation of a precedence table. In @parsley@
these take two forms: a more traditional version called `precHomo` which takes a list of precedence
levels which are all of the same, monolithic, type; and a heterogeneous version called `precedence`.

In /Design Patterns for Parser Combinators/ it is mentioned that the homogeneous approach to
encoding precedence tables can inadvertently misrepresent the grammar: say by changing
left-associative operators into right-associative ones. When the grammar doesn't specify
associativities, then `precHomo` is perfectly appropriate, as it becomes an implementation decision.
Otherwise, `precedence` uses a heterogeneous list to form a precedence table, allowing each layer of
operators to form part of a different datatype. By encoding the resulting AST as a hierarchy of
independent datatypes for each grammar rule, the precedence table can be made to be very strict:
reordering levels or switching their associativities will fail to compile!

This combinator will construct and expression parser will provided with a table of precedence.

precedence (Level lvls op) = level (precedence lvls) op

{-|
A simplified version of `precedence` that does not use the heterogeneous list `Prec`, but
instead requires all layers of the table to have the same type. The list encodes the precedence
in strongest-to-weakest layout.

{-|
Denotes the fixity of a given level in a precedence table. The type parameter @sig@ encodes the
types of the operators on this level, in a heterogeneous fashion.

data Fixity a b sig where
  -- | Denotes a left-associative binary operator.
  InfixL  :: Fixity a b (b -> a -> b)
  -- | Denotes a right-associative binary operator.
  InfixR  :: Fixity a b (a -> b -> b)
  -- | Denotes a non-associative binary operator.
  InfixN  :: Fixity a b (a -> a -> b)
  -- | Denotes a prefix unary operator.
  Prefix  :: Fixity a b (b -> b)
  -- | Denotes a postfix unary operator.
  Postfix :: Fixity a b (b -> b)

{- $ops-doc
By combining a `Fixity` with a `Parser` which can read the operators at a given level, a new
level can be created, ready to add to the table. To provide uniformity and safety, the `Fixity`
type exposes a @sig@ type that expresses the shape of operators that match it. The `Op` datatype,
which is not constructed directly, ties the operators to this signature using existentials.

There are three ways to create a value of type `Op`: `ops`, `sops`, and `gops`. These functions
represent different degrees of relations between this layer of the table, and the one that comes
below:

  - `ops` says that the level below is the same type as this one, in other words the classic
    @a -> a -> a@ type for binary operators.
  - `sops` is stronger, and says that the level below must be a sub-type of this one (see `Subtype`).
    This means that there is a known canonical embedding from one layer into the other, called an
    `upcast`.
  - `gops` is the most general, and says that the level below is related to this one by some more
    complex transformation than the canonical sub-type embedding. Any arbitrary function from
    @underlying -> this@ can be provided to this level to handle the translation.
-}

{-|
Packages together a level of a precedence table, by associating a `Fixity` with the operators that
match that specific signature converting from one layer of type @a@ to a new layer of type @b@.
See `ops`, `sops`, and `gops` for how to construct them.

  Sometimes, the relationship between two levels of a heterogeneous precedence hierarchy is non-trivial.
  By using `gops`, the conversion function can be used to adapt one layer into the type of the next.

This is the default representation used for user-level functions and values: plain old code.

{-|
Encodes a subtyping relationship between two types @sub@ and @sup@. This allows for the conversion
or embedding of one type into the other, as well as their extraction.

It should be the case that:

prop> fmap upcast . downcast = Just
prop> downcast . upcast = Just

class Subtype sub sup where
  -- | Casts a value of the subtype into one of the supertype, likely by wrapping it in some constructor
  upcast   :: sub -> sup

  downcast :: sup -> Maybe sub

{-instance GLens.Context sub sup => Subtype sub sup where
  upcast = GLens.build GLens.derived
  downcast = either (const Nothing) Just . GLens.match GLens.derived-}

{-|
When two levels of a precedence hierarchy are in a subtyping relation, the conversion between
the two can be trivially provided as the `upcast` function.

sops :: Subtype a b => Fixity a b sig -> [Parser sig] -> Op a b
sops fixity ps = gops fixity ps (WQ upcast [||upcast||])

{- $levels-doc
Independently, `Op`s are meaningless: they must be combined together to form a table to be useful.
The `Prec` datatype encodes the structure linking together each `Op` level in turn.

The base case
for the table is called `Atom`, which takes a parser for the root of the table: think numbers,
variables, bracketed expressions, and the like.

The `Level` constructor is used to add layers on top of the growing table. It's not designed to be
used directly, which would be clunky, instead use the `(>+)` and `(+<)` operators. These operators
are sugar for `Level`, but allow freedom over which way round the table should be expressed: use
`(>+)` to build the table from strongest- to weakest-binding (with the atom at the front); use
`(+<)` to build the table from weakest- to strongest-binding (with the atom at the end). The direction
the table should be built in is purely stylistic.
